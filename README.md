# 99CardGame

A simple card game I coded over the weekend. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_(addition_card_game)) for more details
about the game.

The game is console based, and the AI is not super smart, but it should offer a somewhat fun experience to any bored person on the internet.

## Getting started

Simply git clone this repo or download to desktop, then run main.py with python 3.6 (Python 2 will not work!)

This program doesn't use any external libs, so you won't need to install anything
